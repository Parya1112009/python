#Basic Printing

print("Hello World")

#Variables and Types 
# -Numbers

integer = 8
print(integer)
decimal = 7.89
print(decimal)
myfloat = float(89)
print(myfloat)

# -Strings : Single or double quotes work

word = "eva_and_yuvan"
print(word)
word2 = 'ravi_and_priya'
print(word2)
word3 = "Apostrophes shouldn't be in single quotes"

# -Simple operators on numbers and strings

five = 5
six = 6
eleven = five + six

hi = "hi"
bye = "bye"
hibye = "hi" + " and " + "bye"
print(hibye)

nothing = "zero"
something = "fifty billion"
everything = "infinite"
print (nothing, something, everything)
#DON'T MIX OPERATORS BETWEEN STRINGS AND NUMBERS

#Lists

alist.append(2)
alist.append(8)
alist.append(6)
alist.append(7)
alist.append(1)
print (alist [3]) #prints the fourth number
print alist

#Basic Operators

somerandomnumber =( 3 + 5 + 7 - 3) * 4 / 48 + 12

remainder_of_a_number = 5 % 4
print(remainder_of_a_number)
a_number_to_a_power = 5 ** 6

# - Operators with strings

yuvan = "yuvan"
eva = " and eva"
siblings = yuvan + eva
priyanka = "priyanka" * 5
ravi = "ravi" * 5
parents = priyanka + ravi
print(siblings)
print(parents)

# -Operators with lists

some_numbers =  [5, 7, 8, 6, 9]
other_numbers = [ 3, 4, 1, 10, 2]
quite_a_lot_of_numbers = some_numbers + other_numbers

anarray = [2, 5, 5, 6, 7]

#String Formatting
# -Basic Argument Specifiers:
# - %s - String
# - %d - Integers
# - %f - Floating point numbers
# - %. <number of digits>f - Floating point numbers with a fixed amount of digits to the right of the dot
#%x/%X - Integers in hex representation (lowercase/uppercase)

#Basic String Operations
#How many characters are there? (Program, WIP)
